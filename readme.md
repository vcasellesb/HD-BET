# HD-BET

This repository provides easy to use access to our HD-BET
brain extraction tool. HD-BET is the result of a joint project between the
Department of Neuroradiology at the Heidelberg University Hospital, the Divison
for Computational Radiology & Clinical AI, University Hospital Bonn and the
Division of Medical Image Computing at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ).

Compared to other commonly used brain extraction tools, HD-BET has some
significant advantages:

- HD-BET was developed with MRI-data from a large multicentric clinical trial in
  adult brain tumor patients acquired across 37 institutions in Europe and
  included a broad range of MR hardware and acquisition parameters, pathologies
  or treatment-induced tissue alterations. We used 2/3 of data for training and
  validation and 1/3 for testing. Moreover independent testing of HD-BET was
  performed in three public benchmark datasets (NFBS, LPBA40 and CC-359).
- HD-BET was trained with precontrast T1-w, postcontrast T1-w, T2-w and FLAIR
  sequences. It can perform independent brain extraction on various different
  MRI sequences and is not restricted to precontrast T1-weighted (T1-w)
  sequences. Other MRI sequences may work as well (just give it a try!)
- HD-BET was designed to be robust with respect to brain tumors, lesions and
  resection cavities as well as different MRI scanner hardware and acquisition
  parameters.
- HD-BET outperformed five publicly available brain extraction algorithms (FSL
  BET, AFNI 3DSkullStrip, Brainsuite BSE, ROBEX and BEaST) across all datasets
  and yielded median improvements of +1.33 to +2.63 points for the DICE
  coefficient and -0.80 to -2.75 mm for the Hausdorff distance
  (Bonferroni-adjusted p<0.001).
- HD-BET is very fast on GPU with <5s run time per MRI sequence. Even on CPU it
  is not slower than other commonly used tools.

## Installation Instructions

Note that you need to have a python3 installation for HD-BET to work. HD-BET was
extensively tested in Linux but should work on Windows and Mac as well!

We recommend installing HD-BET in a virtual environment.

**Install HD-BET either as a python package (recommended):**
```bash
pip install hd-bet
```

**(Alternatively) install the most recent master from GitHub**
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/HD-BET
   ```
2. Go into the repository (the folder with the pyproject.toml file) and install:
   ```
   pip install -e .
   ```
3. Per default, model parameters will be downloaded to ~/hd-bet_params. If you
   wish to use a different folder, open HD_BET/paths.py in a text editor and
   modify `folder_with_parameter_files`

## How to use it

Using HD-BET is straightforward. You can use it in any terminal on your linux
system. The hd-bet command was installed automatically. We provide GPU as well
as MPS and CPU support. Running on GPU/MPS is a lot faster and should always be
preferred. Here is a minimalistic example of how you can use HD-BET:

```bash
hd-bet -i INPUT_FILENAME -o OUTPUT_FILENAME
```

INPUT_FILENAME must be a nifti (.nii.gz) file containing 3D MRI image data. 4D
image sequences are not supported (however can be split upfront into the
individual temporal volumes using fslsplit<sup>1</sup>). INPUT_FILENAME can be
any MRI sequence. Pre-, postcontrast T1-w, T2-w and FLAIR were used for training
and should work best. Other sequences will most likely work as well. Input
images must match the orientation of standard MNI152
template! Use fslreorient2std <sup>2</sup> upfront to ensure that this is the
case.

By default, HD-BET will run in GPU mode and use test time data
augmentation by mirroring along all axes.

For batch processing it is faster to process an entire folder at once as this
will mitigate the overhead of loading and initializing the model for each case:

```bash
hd-bet -i INPUT_FOLDER -o OUTPUT_FOLDER
```

The above command will look for all nifti files (\*.nii.gz) in the INPUT_FOLDER
and save the brain masks under the same name in OUTPUT_FOLDER.

### GPU is nice, but I don't have one of those... What now?

HD-BET has CPU support. Running on CPU takes a lot longer though and you will
need quite a bit of RAM. To run on CPU, we recommend you use the following
command:

```bash
hd-bet -i INPUT_FOLDER -o OUTPUT_FOLDER -device cpu --disable_tta
```

This works of course also with just an input file:

```bash
hd-bet -i INPUT_FILENAME -device cpu --disable_tta
```

The option --disable_tta will disable test time data augmentation
(speedup of 8x).

HD-BET should also run on mps, just specify `-device mps`

### More options:

For more information, please refer to the help functionality:

```bash
hd-bet -h
```

## FAQ
1. **Will you provide the training code?** It's basically
[nnU-Net](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet) since HD-BET v2. We use
   nnUNetTrainerDA5 with minor (not yet published) modifications.
2. **What run time can I expect on CPU/GPU?** This depends on your MRI image
   size. Typical run times (preprocessing and resampling
   included) are just a couple of seconds for GPU and about 2 Minutes on CPU
   (using `--disable_tta`)
